            I come from a small rural village where dreams are often bigger
            than the resources around you. My father is a businessman who
            studied only up to class 5, and my mother is a homemaker who
            studied till class 9. From that environment, simple, grounded, and
            full of struggle, I built the foundation of who I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since my school days, one dream stayed constant in my mind: to
            become a software engineer. During that time, I first learned about
            software engineering from my sister-in-law, who is a software
            engineer herself. She introduced me to what a software engineer
            does, how they build software, solve real-world problems, and play an
            important role in shaping technology. Listening to her opened a new
            world for me. I did not fully understand everything back then, but
            I knew I wanted to build things, solve problems, and create
            something meaningful through technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I entered college, that dream became clearer and stronger.
            Becoming a software engineer was no longer just a wish; it became
            my fixed target. From my very first day at university to where I
            stand today, I have worked intentionally toward that goal. I
            focused on academics when it mattered, and I invested deeply in
            problem-solving to sharpen my thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, my focus is clear: problem solving and software development.
            I am constantly learning, building, and improving myself step by
            step towards becoming the engineer I once dreamed of.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started in a village, but my ambition has no boundaries.
            My dream is simple, yet bold: to become a top-level software
            engineer in the world.
          </p>
          <p>And this is just the beginning.</p>
